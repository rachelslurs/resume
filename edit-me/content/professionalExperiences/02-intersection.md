- Created the tablet interface for students to engage during a Senate Immersion Module session, where they take on the role of senators, interview experts, amend bills, and vote on bills.
- Developed a Chrome packaged app for World Wide Group that communicated with two RFID readers to change views on an 80-inch 4K screen for an interactive sales office. The RFID readers corresponded with specific floor plans, displayed on the screen, and illuminated the 3D model with the locations of the floor plans within the building.
