- Lead developer of the CMS powering [HillaryClinton.com](https://www.hillaryclinton.com) developed with the product guidance of the campaignâ€™s Chief Product Officer. I used Wordpress as a headless CMS and built out custom fields to support features like time-sensitive content and content based on geo-targeting.
- Built [The Briefing](https://web.archive.org/web/20160705082031/https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/), a tool for the Communications department to respond to breaking news using Jekyll. 
- Built [The Feed](https://web.archive.org/web/20161108080559/https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/), a blog that was used as a campaign storytelling tool which also used the Wordpress headless CMS with custom fields.
- Built out a button that could solicit for a set-amount donation, process a donation, and thank the donor for support, all within the confines of a single button.
